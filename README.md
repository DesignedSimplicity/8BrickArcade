###A simple React front-end integrated with an ASP.NET MVC4 back-end

## Features

1. Server-side rendering of React Components to ensure rendering on devices without JavasScript enabled
1. React Application entry points in multiple Controller/Views to simulate a transitional migration approach
1. Client-side URL routing with animated page transitions allow for an app like user experience
1. Touch enabled 360-degree view for characters with background image preloading

## Description

This combination would be common in an enterprise environment where portions of an existing .NET application are migrated to leverage new front-end frameworks without requiring a full migration all at once.

React Components are built in ES6 compliant JavaScript as JSX files and bundled using ReactJS for ASP.NET.  WebPack and TypeScript are not utilized in order to minimize the scope for this experiment.

Bootstrap is leveraged to provide a well-known responsive layout framework and augmented with custom CSS where required.  All artwork and images 

All design, artwork and images were created to showcase a LEGO project and experiment with studio photography and post processing techniques.
